ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Mlamichhane1!
Iâ€™m an incoming Software Engineering major at Drexel University. Iâ€™m passionate about AI, machine learning, and software development, especially their role in solving real-world problems in healthcare through automation, analytics, and predictive modeling.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently expanding my skills in Python, Java, SQL, and software design principles, while also learning ML frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch and cloud tools like AWS and GCP.

ðŸ’¡ Iâ€™m open to collaborating on software projects, ML/AI applications, Kaggle challenges, and building impactful tools that drive innovation in healthcare and beyond.
