ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Mlamichhane1!
Iâ€™m a B.S. Economics student at Drexel University, pursuing a minor in Data Science. Iâ€™m passionate about AI, data analytics, and software development, and I love exploring how technology can solve real-world economic and healthcare problems through automation, analytics, and predictive modeling.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently growing my skills in Python, SQL, R, and data visualization tools like Tableau and Power BI, while also learning machine learning techniques and working on economics-focused data projects.

ðŸ’¡ Iâ€™m open to collaborating on data analytics dashboards, ML/AI applications, and innovative projects that combine economics, data, and technology.
