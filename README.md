ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Mlamichhane1!
Iâ€™m an incoming Data Science major at Drexel University, minoring in Economics. Iâ€™m passionate about AI and machine learning, especially their role in solving real-world problems in healthcare through automation, analytics, and predictive modeling.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently expanding my skills in Python, SQL, data visualization, and ML frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch. Iâ€™m also learning to work with cloud tools like AWS and GCP.

ðŸ’¡ Iâ€™m open to collaborating on ML/AI projects, Kaggle challenges, and building impactful tools that drive innovation in the healthcare space.
